rdiffdir REQUIRES the following external programs:

bash
rdiff
tar

It will also OPTIONALLY use 'dc' if it exists (currently only used to pretty
up some error messages.) but will work just fine without it as well.

This might work with a shell other than bash, but I wouldn't bet on it. If
you manage to get it working in a different shell by all means let me know.

As it only relies on the tools mentioned above, this should be pretty simple
to get working in Windows or OSX. In Windows I'd imagine Cygwin with the
appropriate packages installed should work without a hitch. In OSX you'd
probably just need to make sure that bash, rdiff, and tar are available
and it should work there as well.

This was just something I threw together in an afternoon, so if it breaks
your system, kills your dog, or makes your wife divorce you, I'm not
responsible. I doubt that it could do any of those things, but you're on
your own either way.

Feel free to email me <demonbane@the-love-shack.net> with any problems, suggestions, etc.
